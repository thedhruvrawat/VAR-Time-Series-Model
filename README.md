## Abstract
Financial markets that function well are very important for the long-run economic growth of a country. This report looks at how the financial development of an economy can be measured. It tests the significant dependence of the following variables on the measurement
of financial development for India: 
1. Index of Financial Development (IFD)
2. Deposit Money Bank Assets to (Deposit Money + Central) Bank Assets (%) (DMB)
3. Liquid Liabilities to GDP (%) (L.L.)
4. Central Bank Assets to GDP (%) (CBA)

For this purpose, data were gathered from the period <b>1980 to 2017</b>. A time-series approach using the <b>VAR Model</b> is used to provide evidence for the dynamic relationship between financial development and the given institutional depth indicators. Finally, this report attempts to
forecast the value of the variables and suggest few policies to increase Indiaâ€™s financial development.
